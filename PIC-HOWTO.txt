If you are wondering how to make pictures for tofuhunt, this is the 
document to read.

This is the first attempt at showing the world how to make tofuhunt pictures,
so please feel free to contribute. 

This will become a web page with screen shots soon. 

DATA LAYOUT

The collection of pictures and maps are laid out as follows : 

data/ --> pics/ (all original pictures) --> diff/ (pictures that have been changed)
					|
					--> maps/ (tab delimited maps of differences)

1. Change the pictures.
	
	This part requires some sort of graphics program like gimp or 
        photoshop. 
	
        You take your picture and then alter it however you feel. Tofuhunt has 
	only five things that are different with the pictures. So, if you are
        below or above 5 then it will bomb out on your pics. So, make five 
        differences in the pictures and then save different image with another
        filename. Both pictures have to be 380x250. This will change in later
        releases. 
	

2. Make the map. 
	
	Using the example that I give you or an imagemap program mark the 
        differences. Note you can only have retangles for now. Also, the rect
        at the bottom the the entire picture. Please make sure that it is 
	in strict html or xml. I use a xml parser to get them and if there 
	is a missing end tag or missing quote then tofuhunt will bomb. This
	will be fixed later on, and just by pass the bad picture, but for 
	now it will bomb.  

Example :

<MAP NAME="TREE">
<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="110,80,170,160"/>
<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,200,260,250"/>
<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,20,30,50"/>
<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="300,200,380,250"/>
<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,100,30,140"/>
<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,380,250"/>
</MAP>

	

3. Test it out. 
	You are ready for testing! Put the original picture in the 'pics'
	directory. Put the other image in the 'diff' directory with the same
	name as the original picture. Then put the xml image map in the 'maps'
	directory. All the names have to be the same. For example, tofu.jpg 
	(original) goes into the 'pics' directory. tofu-diff.jpg (different) 
	goes into the 'diff' directory with the name tofu.jpg . And then the 
	map is called tofu.map and it is put into the 'maps' directory. Then 
	play the game and your pictures should come up. Good Luck!
